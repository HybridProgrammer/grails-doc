Grails runs on any container that supports Servlet 3.0 and above and is known to work on the following specific container products:

* Tomcat 9
* GlassFish 5.0 or above
* Resin 4 or above
* JBoss 6 or above
* Jetty 9.4 or above
* Oracle Weblogic 12c or above
* IBM WebSphere 8.0 or above

NOTE: It's required to set "-Xverify:none" in "Application servers > server > Process Definition > Java Virtual Machine > Generic JVM arguments" for older versions of WebSphere. This is no longer needed for WebSphere version 8 or newer.

Some containers have bugs however, which in most cases can be worked around. A http://grails.org/Deployment[list of known deployment issues] can be found on the Grails wiki.
